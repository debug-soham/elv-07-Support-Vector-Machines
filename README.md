# Task 7: Support Vector Machines (SVM)

This task focused on binary classification using **Support Vector Machines** with both **linear** and **non-linear (RBF)** kernels, applied to the **Breast Cancer Classification** dataset.

## 🧠 Steps Performed
- Loaded and preprocessed the breast cancer dataset.
- Standardized the feature set to improve SVM performance.
- Trained a **Linear SVM** and evaluated its performance.
- Trained an **RBF (Gaussian) Kernel SVM** and compared accuracy.
- Visualized **decision boundaries** using PCA-reduced features.
- Evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and **cross-validation** scores.

## 📊 Results
- **SVM (Linear Kernel) Accuracy**: `0.9561`  
- **SVM (RBF Kernel) Accuracy**: `0.9825`
- **Linear SVM CV Score**: `0.9701`  
- **RBF SVM CV Score**: `0.9736`
- PCA plot confirmed strong class separability.
